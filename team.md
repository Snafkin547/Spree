# Your team introduction 
 Each student should add a separate paragraph to introduce yourself. 

<b>Harunobu Ishii</b>: My name is Harunobu Ishii, enrolled in MS CS. I picked this Master course to switch my career path into the tech field, because, since childhood, I have always been fascinated with programming. After working for 10 years in the commodity trade and the shipping industries in Tokyo and Singapore, I finally decided to actually make it my profession. So, I am in the midst of a career change right now. With regards to my programming experience, though I have learned coding since childhood (on-and-off) and took a few online courses before BU and completed 4 courses at BU so far, I do not have any working experience with it. As a project, I created an analytical tool to visualize global COVID cases and vaccination progress, during the Spring Semester. During this summer, in ML class, I built a neural network model to detect a pothole on a road. Also, I worked on a logistics optimization system, in which you can optimize your logistics pieces such as cargoes, ships, and storages. Otherwise, I did a few small projects like web-scraping and NLP. Since my background has been BtoC businesses, my project ideas so far have tended to incline toward that. So I'd like to explore other kinds of projects like mobile apps and so on. I am a full-time student, I'd be available/flexible for all-day except class hours.
